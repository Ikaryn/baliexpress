1.  Install postgresql

    NOTE: ignore the version number in the tutorial, install version 13.2 (the latest version)
    Also note: I haven't tested installation on windows, please let me know if there are any issues

2.  Creating "baliexpress" database
    Open pgAdmin4
    Set up admin password if prompted
    Enter admin password if prompted
    Open Servers dropdown on left of window
    Right click "databases"
    Create > Database...
    Database: baliexpress
    owner: postgres
    click save

3.  Updating your database (repeat this step as needed to keep your copy of the db up to date)
    In pgAdmin4, right click on "baliexpress" in the menu on the left
    click "delete/drop" and confirm that you want to delete the databases
    repeat step 2 to make a fresh database
    right click your new baliexpress database
    Click "restore..."
    Format: directory
    Filename: find database/baliexpress in your github repo
    click "restore"
    
4.(if you want to use sql shell)
    when prompted with 'Database [postgres]:' type in 'baliexpress'
    (i think thats literally it)

All instructions here are done using the GUI, since that tends to be more
beginner friendly. There are ways to do all of these steps through the command
line, but if you want to do that you'll have to work those out on your own
