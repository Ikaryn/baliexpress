Week 1

Group formed. I created the Jira account. As a whole group we wrote the user stories and decided on all languages, frameworks and libraries. 
I also lead the scrum on Thursday (2/18/21) to gain an understanding of the project, what we're developing, and to delegate work. I also wrote the background section of the proposal. 
I tasked myself with completing the Background, and starting on the userstory Storyboard.

Week 2

Lead a standup on monday to see where everyone was at and what they are working on.
Created proposal document, and completed 90% of the background. 
Started on the Recommendation System storyboard and product pages.

Week 3

Finished storyboards for Recommendation System, Product pages and reviews, and Customer profile pages. 
Also compiled them into the product proposal page.

Week 4

Created codebase for frontend and backend. Together with Darryl Liu we setup the API. 
I also created the foundation for Routes/indexes in frontend that is PublicRoute.js, PrivateRoute.js, index.js. 
I completed register class for backend. Also completed Login, abit of Register (With Darryl Liu), 
and Profile page front end pages (ProfilePageAccountInfo.jsx, StepperComponents.jsx, ProfilePage.jsx, LoginPage.jsx, RegisterPage.jsx, AccInfoBlock.jsx). 
Lastly completed setting up all of the routing/url handling for frontend. 

The technical obstacles was setting up the initial api. We tried following flask documentation, but had different usecases. We had alot of problems around CORS
and routing. After a bunch of googling we had fixed the problem by adding CORS(app) to our file.

Week 5

We (all of us) planned to finish off the bulk of the product pages done since the last diary entry.

I Created and Finished off assigned user stories, that is profile page, product list, and product pages (Minus sorting/filtering)(ProductPage.js, ProductListPage.jsx, ProductCard.jsx). 
Also fixed errors in add/edit products and setting admin status with Darryl. Adding and editing products I believe was developed quite poorly, where it was essentially
imcomplete close of the demo date, so I refactored add products(ProductForm.jsx).
After demo, we set up a meeting for a retro on Thursday (3/18/2019). Also completed navbar functionality where I could. 
I implemented AllProductList.jsx , to view all product tab for admin users in profile page - All by myself.

Since the database wasn't connected at this point and time, we had to come up and use alot of dummy data. 
After the demo we had planned to connect the database with the backend/frontend. We had also sat down and delegated jira tickets for everyone.

Week 6

From the last diary entry we had connected the database with the backend, this created some problems with accessing the api, in terms of naming semantics.
Once we standardised the names, it was sorted easily.

Converted website into a dark mode. Created the build PC page with relevant components 
(BuildPage.jsx, BuildProductCard.jsx, BuildModalForm.jsx, SelectBuildPRoductModal.KSX, SelectProductCard.jsx) -All by myself.

Initially with our dummy data, we had to improvise image strings. When we integrated the database all of this was completely lost. So we had to figure out a way to do this.
At this time and point, the backend wasn't setup for the build-A-PC recommendation system, so I was only able to complete the skeleton of interaction.

For the next week, we had planned to finish off the recommendation system and its coupled components.

Week 7

Along side with Darryl Liu, we came up with the algorithm to calculate performance on the comparison page in DataVis.js. 
I then wrote ComparePage.jsx, CompareProductCard.jsx. -All by myself. Started the framework for Reviews. 
Created ReviewBlock.jsx, ReviewCard.jsx, ReviewForm.jsx - all by myself.

Alot of the obstacles I had faced was around calculating performance values, and creating actual performance weightings. This was overcome by getting help from
some of the more knowledgable group members like Darryl Liu.

Next week was our demo, so it was important to finish off the rest of the tickets assigned.

Week 8.

Added featured reviews, sorting and filtering reviews. Implemented the HomePage, 
created the design for the Build-A-PC button image. Fixed alot of bugs in BuildPage. 
Added some helper text in BuildPCForm, and in build product cards. 
Implemented edit builds, users builds, and save Build PCs for frontend and backend(only for edit and save). 
I wrote the frontend Sales Components, ProductSaleCard.jsx, SaleForm.jsx, SalePanel.jsx -All by myself.

Week 9.

Wrote the initial PaymentPage, along side with the Payment components. 
Brainstormed with Darryl Liu and Marcus Lee on the chatbot functionality. 
I wrote the functionality of the chatbot. I rewrote the cart, and added more functionality to it. 
Added more polish to product and list pages. Fixed bugs with Build Page.  -All by myself

Week 10.

Darryl, Marcus, and Joanna had a meeting in the morning to discuss the demo. During our run through we discovered a bunch of bugs.
I had spent the monday finishing as much of the backlogged tickets we created during the demo.

I encountered some technical problems surrounding the build page. I had to refactor the way it worked to handle
editting and saving build. But since the build page has 3 entry points, and all of them had different ways of interacting with
the build page, I had to standardize the way the build object is created and set. I also problems with how the build page should interact with
refreshing the page, using the form on the same page, and accessing the page via edit. For creating a new custom build, and accessing a saved version
of the build, it works fine. But because of the way that the state works with the library I use, its difficult to reset the page with an empty template
that has some components filled out. It's something small, if the user wants a fresh template they can either refresh the page, or just remove the added products.
